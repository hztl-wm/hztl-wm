<h1>ðŸ‘‹ I'm William Harrison</h1>

As a Frontend Developer, I work mostly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but sometimes pretend that I am actually a full stack developer and cobble together React apps and construct weird queries in PostgresQL (because I have no idea).

I primarily keep this site for [workshop] notes, there are some resources I gather along the way as well, and sometimes I will add a little JavaScript or style update that seems fun when I am working on a project.

Built in Jekyll with the USWDS theme and deployed with Github Pages.
