## Discovery - PPT PDF Viewer

The scope of this story is to determine if there is a good solution to showing PPT and PDF files on page. Weâ€™ve discussed functionality similar to what Confluence has today. This could be a library or 3rd party tool.

### Current State

Currently, AB does not have an integrated PPT or PDF viewer. All of the current links on AB found that have PDF files linked will either open the PDF in a separate tab (behavior experiences in Google Chrome) or download the PDF (untested in other browsers).

### Initial Findings

Short of making all documents into PDFs, there does not appear to be a single solution for displaying both PPT and PDF files, but separate solutions for each. The following list is by no means a suggestion or selection, but a collection of what has been discovered.

OR...export PPT as a PDF?
