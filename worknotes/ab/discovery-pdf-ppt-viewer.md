## Discovery - PPT PDF Viewer

The scope of this story is to determine if there is a good solution to showing PPT and PDF files on page. Weâ€™ve discussed functionality similar to what Confluence has today. This could be a library or 3rd party tool.

### Initial Findings

Short of making all documents into PDFs, there does not appear to be a single solution for displaying both PPT and PDF files, but separate solutions for each. The following list is by no means a suggestion or selection, but a collection of what has been discovered.

OR...export PPT as a PDF?
