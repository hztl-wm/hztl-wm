Totally missed almost 2 entire months due to increased project work and chaotic life mess. Have recently been working on SVG animations with GSAP and IE11* is still the worst thing that Microsoft has done in the history of all things, but I will get through this and show y'all some of the things I learn along the way

*well IE anything for that matter, but for the purposes of my current project, IE11 is all I 'care' about
