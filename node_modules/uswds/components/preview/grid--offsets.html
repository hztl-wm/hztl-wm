            Georgia is a state located in the southeastern United States. It was
            established in 1732 and was the last of the original Thirteen
            Colonies. Named after King George II of Great Britain, Georgia was
            the fourth state to ratify the United States Constitution, on
            January 2, 1788. Georgia declared its secession from the Union on
            January 19, 1861, and was one of the original seven Confederate
            states. Georgia was the last state to be restored to the Union, on
            July 15, 1870. Georgia is the 24th largest and the 8th most populous
            of the 50 United States.
