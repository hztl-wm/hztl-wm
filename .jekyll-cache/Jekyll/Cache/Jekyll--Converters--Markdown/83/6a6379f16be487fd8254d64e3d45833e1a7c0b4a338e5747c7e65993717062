I"'<p>Discovery - JW Player
The scope of this story is to gain a better understanding of capabilities and integrations needed to implement JW Player on the site.</p>

<p>Some things to think about:</p>

<p>Current State
What is the current state? (Does it exist on current site, is this new functionality, etc.)
Why are we using this?
Why do we need to continue using this?
Capabilities
What are its features?
What are the benefits to using this (current, if upgraded, etc.) vs something else
Are there any alternatives that might be better?
What are areas of concerns, possible blockers, etc.
Ease of implementation
Browser support
Known issues or other challenges
POC
How to install, what assets/files to add, etc.
How to implement JS
How to customize /configure settings?
How to implement CSS
How to implement HTML
How to integrate into Sitecore/SXA, etc.
Are there related modules you can use to make things easier?
Any JW Player for Sitecore modules that might help?
Any general video player modules to leverage that might help?
Anything to update in relation to FED tooling, npm, gulp, etc.?
Are there any UI things to consider and account for:
Mobile vs tablet vs desktop layout
Needs to appear in certain components, modals, special logic not OOTB, etc.
Next Steps
