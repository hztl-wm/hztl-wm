<p>The scope of this story is to determine if there is a good solution to showing PPT and PDF files on page. Weâ€™ve discussed functionality similar to what Confluence has today. This could be a library or 3rd party tool.</p>

<h3 id="current-state">Current State</h3>

<p>Currently, AB does not have an integrated PPT or PDF viewer. All of the current links on AB found that have PDF files linked will either open the PDF in a separate tab (behavior experiences in Google Chrome) or download the PDF (untested in other browsers).</p>

<h3 id="initial-findings">Initial Findings</h3>

<p>Short of exporting all documents into PDFs (or all documents into JPG sequences), there does not appear to be a single solution for displaying both (native) PPT and PDF files, but separate solutions for each.</p>

<p>Confluence uses a script called <a href="/worknotes/ab/mediaviewer-2.js">mediaviewer-2.js</a> (this is a copy of the JavaScript file for reference) which, similar to some of the options below, converts PPT and PDF files to images (stored in the server using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">blob</a>), then displays the images in a modal, also retaining the original file which can be downloaded.</p>

<h3 id="ppt">PPT</h3>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11308896">Make your own PPT viewer</a> by converting the PPT to an image format and serving it up with an interactive carousel or other. An example of this implementation can be found <a href="http://www.vanguarddata.com.au/training/vgd101a_optic_fibre_fundamentials.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/w3nl/ppt-png#readme">As above, import a PPT, convert to PNG or JPG, then wrap extracted images in a carousel</a> - Another custom solution that can handle both PPT and PDF files which have been converted to images.</p>

<p>Last resort; Export PPT as a PDF?</p>
