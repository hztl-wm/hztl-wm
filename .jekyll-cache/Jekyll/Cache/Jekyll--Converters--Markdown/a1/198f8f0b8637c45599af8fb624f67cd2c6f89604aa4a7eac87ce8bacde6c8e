<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulty ramps up considerably, but if you stick with it you will reap the rewards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take responsibility for your learning - don’t make excuses for why you cannot learn something, figure out how to measure your learning (it is different for everyone)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the questions asked</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t read too much. If you are trying to learn a skill that requires you to solve problems, it’s not always as productive as it may feel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teach other people, explain what you learned and how it works</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h3>

<p>Functional programming has become popular to the point that functional programming and utility methods have been integrated into modern frameworks. Functional programming is about breaking code into verbs, vs object oriented programming being about nouns. It is easier to think about software in terms of objects because that’s where we, as humans, live in the physical world. Whereas with functional programming, you need to think in terms of the actions. In functional programming, the focus is on… functions. Lots of functions, functions being passed to functions, functions being returned from functions, working with parameters and arguments. One benefit of functional programming vs object oriented programming: Pure functions don’t have side-effects - makes code easier to test</p>
