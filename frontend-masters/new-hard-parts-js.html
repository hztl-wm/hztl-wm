<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p>The instructor for this course, Will Sentance, is the founder of <a href="https://codesmith.io/">Codesmith</a>. He lets everyone know how amazing it is and that the graduates of his program earn a reasonable salary at big tech companies. Great. More importantly, the content covered in this workshop is what job seekers get asked the most in interviews. Event loop and closure are two of the very important topics. Also, here is a list of things that companies look for in mid - senior level candidates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Analytical problem solving with code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical communication (can I implement your approach just from your explanation)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Engineering best practices and approach (debugging, code structure, patience, and reference to documentation)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Non-technical communication (empathetic and thoughtful communication)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language and computer science experience</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="javascript-code-execution">JavaScript Code Execution</h3>

<p>If you’ve already taken / read my notes on, Javascript: The Hard Parts, this next bit may look familiar, but a refresher never hurt. It is important to understand how the JavaScript engine executes code, having this understanding will make it easier to comprehend the content of this workshop.</p>

<p>What happens when JavaScript executes (runs) my code?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">multiplyBy2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">inputNumber</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">inputNumber</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Will</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When JavaScript code is executed, a ‘global execution context’ is created and two things happen when JavaScript executes the above (or any…) code. One, a ‘thread of execution’ is created which parses and executes the code line by line. Two, a live memory of variables with data (known as a ‘global variable environment’) is created. In the above code, the <strong>only</strong> thing ‘happening’ is 3 pieces of data are being stored in the ‘global variable environment’ aka memory; num, multiplyBy2, name. Adding on to the above example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">multiplyBy2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">inputNumber</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">inputNumber</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">multiplyBy2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">newOutput</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">multiplyBy2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newOutput</code>, we are actually storing the result of the multiplyBy2 function. To do that, a new execution context is created for each, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newOutput</code>, with their own separate local memory / variable environments, within the global execution context. Walking through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output</code>, would be something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New (local) execution context is created</li>
  <li>Local memory is created, storing the function’s parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputNumber</code> with the passed in argument value of 4</li>
  <li>A label for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result</code> is created in local memory in which is stored the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputNumber</code> * 2… 8</li>
  <li>Finally, the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result</code> is returned out to the global execution context’s variable environment memory</li>
</ul>

<p>While setting the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outuput</code> by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multiplyBy2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newOutput</code> will have an undefined value because JavaScript can only execute one thing at a time. Also, once the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output</code> is set, the local execution context that was created to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multiplyBy2</code> is ‘garbage collected’ (deleted).</p>

<p>The last thing that is important to know about in this foundational review of JavaScript, is the call stack. Imagine JavaScript is like a stack of plates, with the global execution context being the first (or bottom) plate, while each additional execution context gets placed on top of the stack of plates in the order in which it was called. i.e. a new function call creates a new execution context which gets added to the call stack of plates, when that execution context is exited, the plate gets removed and JavaScript returns to the execution context that it was previously in, in this case the global execution context. Adding to the call stack(s) technical term is ‘push’, removing from the call stack(s) technical term is ‘pop’… similar to arrays.</p>

<h2 id="asynchronous-javascript">Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>

<h3 id="introducing-asynchronicity">Introducing Asynchronicity</h3>

<p>Asynchronicity is the backbone of modern web development in JavaScript. JavaScript is single threaded and has a synchronous execution model. But what if we need to wait until we get some data back from an API? It would be nice to be able to wait for some code to execute, but not block the entire execution thread from executing any other code while it is also waiting… It is also important to note that there are a ton of features that JavaScript has access to but are not directly within the language itself; i.e. ‘speaking to the internet’, this is a browser feature. Take a look at this code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">display</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">dataFromAPI</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fetchAndWait</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">https:/twitter.com/viljar/tweets/1</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">//... user can do NOTHING here 😞</span>
<span class="c1">//... could take 300ms, could never finish</span>
<span class="c1">//... they're clicking and getting nothing until it finishes</span>

<span class="nx">display</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dataFromAPI</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Run me later!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Executing the above code goes like so: Declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dataFromAPI</code> to result of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetchAndWait</code>, execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dataFromAPI</code> as its argument, console.log ‘Run me later!’. It’s pretty straightforward, but the wrench in the flow is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dataFromAPI</code>. While that is being set, we have no idea how much time will pass before it is complete and it will block the rest of our code from executing until it is finished…</p>

<p>The above code ‘works’, but in a synchronous manner. If we didn’t care about the functionality of our application it would be fine. But we do care about the functionality of our application and we need to have the ability asynchronously execute code.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous-web-browser-apis">Asynchronous Web Browser APIs</h3>

<p>In order to get some asynchronous features, we need to interface with external environments to introduce them. Let’s look at how the web browser helps with asynchronicity. One feature that the web browser ‘lends’ to JavaScript is the DOM (Document Object Model) which are the elements on the ‘page’ that JavaScript can interact with. Console is another web browser feature that is outside of JavaScript. Local storage, ability to speak to the internet, XHR; all of these are not JavaScript features. To bring asynchronicity to JavaScript, we need <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web Browser APIs</a> / Node Background Threads. Take a look at this code and then we’ll walk through it / break down what it is doing.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">printHello</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Hello</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">printHello</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Print me first!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here’s how the above code executes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declare a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code></li>
  <li>Call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> with the arguments <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1000</code> (milliseconds) - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> is not a feature / function which exists in JavaScript, but rather is a ‘Web Browser feature’. Calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> will ‘spin up’ an instance of a ‘Timer’ which in this case will take a reference to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> function and be set to 1000ms</li>
  <li>Console <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log</code> “Print me first!”, which will immediately print to the console</li>
  <li>After ~1001ms, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> will have finished and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> will be pushed to the call stack and executed, printing “Hello” to the console.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="asynchronous-web-browser-apis-qa">Asynchronous Web Browser APIs Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Q: How do you work with ‘layers’? i.e. if the function called in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> had another <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> in it?</p>

<p>A: We’ll come back to that.</p>

<p>Q: What happens if I am actively executing something on the call stack, when will the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> be ‘allowed’ on the call stack?</p>

<p>A: Good question.</p>

<p>Come on Will… You literally did not answer these questions.</p>

<h3 id="calling-the-outside-world">Calling the Outside World</h3>

<p>Here’s another look using the Web Browser API <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> and another blocking function:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">printHello</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Hello</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">blockFor1Sec</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// blocks JavaScript thread of execution for 1 second</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">printHello</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">blockFor1Sec</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Print me first</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here’s what will happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockFor1Sec</code> - this is probably a loop of some sort that takes 1sec</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> as the arguments - it is technically ready, but cannot be run yet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockFor1Sec</code> on the call stack and execute it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Print ‘Print me first’ to the console</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> is allowed to run</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Why does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> not get run until the end?! There is another component to JavaScript that we’ve not yet seen, the  Callback Queue. When the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> is ready, the function is first put in the Callback Queue. The Callback Queue checks the Call Stack to see if it can add to it, which it is allowed to do only when the Call Stack is empty and all of the Global Execution Context code is finished running. The process of checking the Call Stack and the Global Execution Context is called the Event Loop.</p>

<h3 id="calling-the-outside-world-qa">Calling the Outside World Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Q: Where is the Callback Queue? Is it a Web Browser feature?</p>

<p>A: That is a JavaScript engine feature.</p>

<p>Q: How are is the Callback Queue prioritized? i.e. what if you have more than one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code>?</p>

<p>A: They are put in the Callback Queue as they are ready. (not clear if it functions like the call stack, or if they are placed in the order that they are ready…)</p>

<p>Q: Is the Callback Queue a stack?</p>

<p>A: It is a queue. It is a ‘first in, first out’ queue. If you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printGoodbye</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printNothing</code>, if they were added to the Callback Queue in that order, they would be executed in that same order.</p>

<p>Q: What does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setInterval</code> do?</p>

<p>A: It is similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code>, in that it is another Web Browser API.</p>

<p>Q: Is there a limit to the size of the Callback Queue?</p>

<p>A: The function is not actually stored in the Callback Queue, it is stored in JavaScript memory, so the question more technically is, “Is there a to JavaScript memory for function definitions?”. The answer to which is, yes…</p>

<p>Q: Is the Event Loop a part of the JavaScript engine?</p>

<p>A: Yes.</p>

<p>Q: What happens when you pass an anonymous function to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code>?</p>

<p>A: Even without a ‘label’, function definitions are stored in memory with a position.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up-web-browser-apis">Wrapping Up Web Browser APIs</h3>

<p>What are the problems of Web Browser APIs?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>None - It is super intuitive</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Response data is only available in the callback function AKA callback hell</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe  it feels odd to think of passing a function into another function only for it to run later</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Super explicit once you understand how it works under-the-hood</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="asynchronous-exercises">Asynchronous Exercises</h3>

<p>There is no better way to grow as a software engineer than pair programming. If you are just watching video workshops or reading articles, you are likely not hitting any of the ‘blocks’ that require you to try hard to get through which is what allows you to grow as an engineer. Code challenges, difficult projects, pair programming all help you grow. Pair programming is especially important as you have a navigator who’s job it is to verbalize precisely how the program should function and a driver who is required to make the implementation of the code. The navigator is not allowed to ever touch the keyboard, so they are ‘forced’ to use technical communication to effectively communicate their ‘vision’. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">Here’s some more details about pair programming</a>. Ideally with a partner, answer these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I know what a variable is</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve created a function before</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve added a CSS style before</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have implemented a sort algorithm (bubble, merge, etc)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can add a method too an object’s prototype</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand the event loop in JavaScript</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I understand callback functions</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2 id="promises">Promises</h2>

<h3 id="introducing-promises">Introducing Promises</h3>

<p>Promises are special objects built into JavaScript that get returned immediately when we make a call to a web browser API / feature (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code>) that’s set up to return promises (not all are). Promises act as a placeholder for the data we hope to get back from the web browser feature’s background work. We also attach the functionality we want to defer running until that background work is done (using the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.then</code> method). Promise objects will automatically trigger that functionality to run. The value returned from the web browser feature’s work will be that function’s input / argument.</p>

<h3 id="promises-1">Promises</h3>

<p>Now that we have seen the promise of promises, let’s look at a third approach to asynchronous code, which is a two-pronged ‘facade’ function  that both initiates background web browser work <em>and</em> returns a placeholder object (a promise) immediately in JavaScript:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">display</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">futureData</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">https://twitter.com/viljar/tweets/1</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">futureData</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">display</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// attached display functionality</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Print me first!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As usual, here’s a breakdown of how the above code executes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futureData</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> function starts to run. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> triggers the web browser feature <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XMLHttpRequest</code> and immediately returns an object with a property on it called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code>. The object would look something like this:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">value</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">onFulfillment</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[...]</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When the web browser feature completes the request, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> in the above object will be updated with the result of the request. <em>And</em>, when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> gets ‘filled in’, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array (which is an array of functions) gets triggered / run. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> which means that it is retrieving data as opposed to sending data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futureData.then</code> is how ‘we’ are able to ‘store’ a function in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> property of the promise object returned from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code>. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futureData.then(display)</code> is effectively ‘storing’ the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function (or rather a reference to it) in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> property (which is  an array) of the promise object returned from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log</code> prints ‘Print me first!’, which completes all of the synchronous code in our program. But there is still an unfulfilled process happening in the background…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unfulfilled process is the XHR browser feature that was triggered by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fecth</code>. Imagine that request is now complete and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> property of the promise object gets updated. Now, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array of functions gets automatically triggered, which in our code contains the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function will <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log</code> the data that was returned from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, with this approach, we are able to start a task that takes a long time, continue running through our JavaScript code, and when the data comes back, we were able to ‘auto-trigger’ functionality (that we set; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function) on the returned data. 🔥</p>

<h3 id="promises-qa">Promises Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Q: Does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> use the event loop?</p>

<p>A: Yes, but in a really interesting way 🤦🏻‍♂️</p>

<p>Q: Does the (XHR) web browser feature directly set memory or does it use the event loop?</p>

<p>A: Will Sentance refuses to answer…</p>

<p>Q: Why are we using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> for the variable that will eventually get updated when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> operation is complete? I thought that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> was not able to be modified?!</p>

<p>A: For primitive values stored in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>, they are unable to be changed. Objects and arrays though… they can be modified as long as you do not get rid of the object or array… i.e. you can add properties to the object or positions to the array.</p>

<p>Q: If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> ‘function’ triggered by JavaScript or the web browser?</p>

<p>A: JavaScript.</p>

<h3 id="promises--microtask-queue">Promises &amp; Microtask Queue</h3>

<p>How does the promise deferred functionality get back into JavaScript to be run?! Let’s break down the following code to get a comprehensive understanding of how asynchronous code works:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">display</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">printHello</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Hello</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">blockFor300ms</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// blocks js thread for 300ms with long for loop</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">printHello</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">futureData</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">fetch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">https://twitter.com/viljar/tweets/1</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">futureData</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">then</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">display</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">blockFor300ms</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// which will run first?</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Print me first!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And… here’s how the above code executes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockFor300ms</code> as functions stored in global memory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> is passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> which a ‘timer’ value of 0 (zero). 0 does not tell us when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> will run, but for how long will the ‘timer’ of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> run for… When <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> actually executes is not known. But, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> does get added to the Callback Queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futureData</code> is declared, but remains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undefined</code> until a moment later when it is set to a (Promise) object like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{value: undefined, onFulfillment: [...]}</code> - when the web browser feature (XHR) completes, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> will get updated with the result which then triggers any functions in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array of the Promise object. The web browser feature (XHR) needs a URL, path, and a method (auto-defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futureData.then</code> is passed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function which ‘adds’ a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function reference to the array stored in the  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> property of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futureData</code> Promise object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blockFor300ms</code> gets run; however it works, it is blocking any additional code for 300ms. While that function is running, the XHR web browser feature completes and receives back a response, which is then updates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> property of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">futureData</code> Promise object, this triggers the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> function is added to the Microtask / Job Queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log("Print me first!")</code> is executed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Event Loop prioritizes tasks in the Microtask Queue, so even though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> has been waiting in the Callback Queue since the beginning of time, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code>, which is in the Microtask Queue, gets run first! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log</code>(s) the value that was returned from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Finally</strong>, all of the synchronous code has executed and the Microtask Queue is empty, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printHello</code> is able to be run.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="microtask-queue-qa">Microtask Queue Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Q: Are there any other browser features that use the Microtask Queue instead of the Callback Queue?</p>

<p>A: Yes, but you would need to check the JavaScript specification docs to find exactly which ones. Job queue = Microtask queue, Task queue = Callback queue. Keep in mind that the spec is not necessarily how JavaScript gets implemented. For a long time, browsers other than Chrome put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> into the Callback Queue…</p>

<p>Q: How was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> property of the Promise object updated? It seems like it skipped over the Callback Queue, Call Stack, Event Loop, etc…</p>

<p>A: The assignment of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> is ‘likely’ not set until the Call Stack is empty, but the important thing is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> being set triggers the functions in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array…</p>

<p>Q: If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> gets updated again and triggers the functions stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array, do they (the functions) get added to the Microtask queue?</p>

<p>A: Yes, you can starve the Callback queue if the Microtask queue is never emptied.</p>

<p>There is a third property on the Promise object; that is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> property. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> property is actually what triggers the functions in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code> can be: pending, resolved, or rejected. When status is resolved is actually what triggers the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFulfillment</code> array of functions. AND there is a fourth property on the Promise object; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onRejected</code>, which is another array of functions for when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> fails… You can pass functions into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onRejected</code> array as a second argument in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.then(onF, onR)</code> or use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.catch()</code> to only specify a function in the event of an error.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up-promises">Wrapping Up Promises</h3>

<p>Now, with the Microtask queue, JavaScript can be an asynchronous language. And thanks to web browsers, there are a ton of asynchronous features available to JavaScript. 99% of developers have no idea how Promises work under the hood, but if you have read the above, you do understand. If you do not understand them, Promises make debugging harder. If you do understand Promises, you end up with a cleaner and more readable style of code with a pseudo-synchronous style to it AND a nice error handling process.</p>

<p>In summary… Promises, Web APIs, the Callback &amp; Microtask Queues, and the Event Loop allow us to defer actions until the ‘work’ (an API request, timer, etc) is completed and continue running our code in the meantime. Asynchronous JavaScript is the backbone of the modern web - letting us build fast and in a ‘non-blocking’ way.</p>

<h2 id="iterators">Iterators</h2>

<h3 id="returning-function-inside-a-function">Returning Function Inside a Function</h3>

<p>It is often the case that we have some data in our application that we need to update, but it is not often the case that the data is a single item, but usually a collection of some sort… an array, object, etc… So the updating of data, the finding of the correct element to update is of itself a task. Also, you generally just want a specific element, then the next one, then the next, and so on. How that happens doesn’t really matter… Imagine that your data is a stream that is coming towards you and this is a way of accessing the next element in that flow. So instead of your data being a static source, imagine it being a flow that you could turn on and off to get the next element as needed 🤯</p>

<p>Before we look at this ‘new way’ of working with / iterating over data, let’s look at the ‘old way’.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">numbers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">numbers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And… here is how that executes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> and assign an array to it containing the numbers; 4, 5, 6</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loop then executes… it is essentially checking if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> is less than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers.length</code> and while that condition returns true; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log(numbers[i])</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i++</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Great… The eventual ‘new way’ that we get to will be way better. Until then, let’s read this:</p>

<p>Programs store data and apply functionality to it. But there are two parts to applying functions to collections of data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The process of accessing each element</li>
  <li>What we want to do to each element</li>
</ol>

<p>Iterators automate the accessing of each element - so we can focus on what to do to each element - and make it available to us in a smooth way</p>

<p>Imagine if wee could create a function that stored <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> and each time we ran the function it would return out an element (the next one) from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code>. NOTE: It would have to remember which element was next somehow.</p>

<p>BUT… this would let us think of our array/list as a ‘stream’ or flow of data with our function returning the next element from our ‘stream’ - this makes our code more readable and more functional.</p>

<p><strong>But it starts with us returning a function from another function</strong></p>

<p>🤔 some of that seems like we’ve already read it before… 🤷‍♂️ guess it doesn’t hurt to iterate over the subject of iteration?</p>

<p>One of the most powerful features of JavaScript is returning a function from another function and we’ll see why in just a moment. Consider this bit of code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">createNewFunction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">add2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">num</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">num</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">add2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">newFunction</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">createNewFunction</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">newFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>How can we run/call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add2</code> now? Outside of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createNewFunction</code>?</p>

<p>I imagine we will answer those question(s) if we walk through the code… Here’s that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createNewFunction</code> and store it in global memory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newFunction</code>, the value of which is set to the return value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createNewFunction</code>. This creates a new execution context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving inside of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createNewFunction</code>, a new function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add2</code> is created in the local memory of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createNewFunction</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add2</code> is returned from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createNewFunction</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newFunction</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createNewFunction</code> execution context is ‘garbage collected’ (removed from memory).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Declare <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result</code>, the value of which is set to the return value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newFunction(3)</code> (which invokes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newFunction</code>, creating a new execution context).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inside of the new execution context created by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">newFunction</code> and inside of that execution contexts local memory, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num</code> parameter is stored with the argument of 3. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num</code> + 2 is returned out to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">result</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="return-next-element-with-a-function">Return Next Element with a Function</h3>

<p>Wonderful… now we can set the value of a variable to be the return value of a function (which is another function), but why would that be of any use?! Why not just define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add2</code> globally?! Because when you return a function from another function, you get… Damnit Will, the rhetorical question lead-ins always trip me up. Before we talk about the benefits of returning a function from a function, lets look at some more code!</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">createFunction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">array</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">inner</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">element</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">array</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">];</span>
        <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">inner</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">returnNextElement</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">createFunction</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>^ ^ How can we access the first element in the list?! By walking through the code line-by-line!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Define a function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createFunction</code>, in global memory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement</code>, in global memory. Its value defaults to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">undefined</code> until <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createFunction</code> is executed and returns a value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createFunction</code> makes a new execution context, the array; [4, 5, 6] is stored in local memory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> is set to 0, and the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inner</code> is declared and stored in local memory. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inner</code> is returned from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createFunction</code> and stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement</code>. The execution context of calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createFunction</code> is removed from memory.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, hopefully… we should be able to call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement</code> and ‘get’ the <em>next</em> element returned. Yes, that’s exactly how it works… <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement()</code></p>

<p>With each call of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement</code>, a new execution context is created in the local memory of which is declared the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">element</code> which is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array[i]</code>… but what is the value of either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>?! Well, initially, JavaScript will check local memory and when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> are not found, where does JavaScript check next? Global? no… Even though the execution context of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createFunction</code> was removed, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement</code> does retain the data that was stored in the local memory of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createFunction</code>… so the next place that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement</code> looks for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> is technically itself? Yep. The function definition did retain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code>. So in this way, we are able to ‘iterate’ over the array and get the correct next element from repeatedly calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">returnNextElement</code>.</p>

<h3 id="iterator-function">Iterator Function</h3>

<p>The ‘backpack’ of (referenced) data that we get when returning a function from a function is known as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Persistent Lexical Scope Referenced Data - This is a <strong>very</strong> literal way of defining what the referenced data <em>could</em> be called. Perhaps impressive, but not colloquial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Closed Over Variable Environment - C.O.V.E.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Backpack - Makes some sense, as the data is ‘on’ / ‘attached to’ the surrounding function that returned the function… The instructor is trying to hard sell on using ‘The Backpack’ as the best name</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Closure - Most engineers call it this, but the whole concept of functions retaining their lexical environment reference is known as closure, not just the referenced data from the original lexical scope</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any function that when called gives out the next element from a flow of data is known as an iterator. Iterators turn data into ‘streams’ of actual values that can be accessed one after the other.</p>

<p>Now we have functions that hold an underlying array, the current position in the array, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> out the next item in the ‘stream’ of elements from the array when run.</p>

<p>This allows us to have loops that show us the element itself in the body on each loop and <em>more deeply</em> allows us to rethink arrays as flows of elements themselves which we can interact with by calling a function that switches that flow on to give us the next element (in the array).</p>

<p>This ‘decouples’ the process of accessing each element from what we want to do to each element.</p>
