<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p>This workshop will cover a ‘style’ of functional programming that the instructor, Kyle Simpson, has developed; Functional-Light JS. You can also read Kyle’s book of the same name <a href="https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS">here</a>. ‘Light’ is not intended to allude to the depth or level of difficulty of this workshop, rather ‘Light’ refers to the workshops’ intention to not weigh you down with terminology or mathematic notation. This workshop will take a ‘bottom-up’ approach to Functional Programming in JavaScript, an approach that does not make the assumption that you have a background in mathematics or knowledge of specific terminology.</p>

<h3 id="why-functional-programming">Why Functional Programming</h3>

<p>One of the biggest reasons to learn functional programming is because it is, in Kyle’s opinion, impossible to write functional programming in isolation. Meaning that if you bring these concepts back to work and write some code in a functional programming style, submit a pull request, that it is then somehow magically going to now be the way that your team writes code. Nope… It is important to learn functional programming so that you can convince others of its importance.</p>

<p>Functional programming is not imperative, it is declarative. An imperative approach is one that is primarily focused on how to do something; i.e. add a bunch of numbers from an array and return the result, would probably lead you to having an accumulator variable and a for loop to loop over the array and add each number in the array to the accumulator variable. But this is an imperative approach because a future reader of your code would have to read all of your code to understand what is happening. This is <em>fine</em>. but the being that benefits most from imperative code is the computer, not the human. A declarative approach focuses on the what, the outcome; which should, by its very nature, make your code inherently more obvious as to what its purpose is and what it does. Functional programming != declarative, but it is <strong>more</strong> declarative than it is imperative.</p>

<h3 id="functional-programming-journey">Functional Programming Journey</h3>

<p>The instructor, and maybe you or myself?, admits to starting off with somewhat readable but imperative (non-functional) code which evolved to less readable but closer to declarative code, finally ending up at highly readable and functional code. He points out that in the middle of that journey is where most people ‘drop-off’ from continuing to pursue functional programming. The ‘pit of despair’ is that point when most people ‘drop-off’ from continuing to pursue functional programming and the instructor admits he hit this point, but stresses the importance of continuing on, of continuing to pursue ones understanding of functional programming. Small wins will turn into bigger wins will turn into something that is greater than no understanding whatsoever of functional programming. The important thing is to keep at it!</p>

<p>No one can remove the fact that functional programming is difficult, but an aim of this course is to make it approachable and more manageable. It will be important for you to find comfort in the unfamiliar and keep the faith when your code becomes less readable on your functional programming journey, when you learn a new concept or approach this is how it will be at first, but it is important to trust the process of learning and know that at some point you will understand what you are doing and your code will become more readable.</p>

<h3 id="code-is-provable">Code is Provable</h3>

<p>Functional programming is based on mathematical principles. It is likely that we’ve all written code that did not pass a test and then we fumble through trying to figure out how to get whatever we’re working on to pass the test. But what would it be like if when you wrote some code that you were then going to test that you were 100% certain of the outcome? Would that fact make you a more effective programmer? Would you have more confidence? Would you drop your sense of being an imposter?! The set of techniques associated with functional programming are not just a nicely designed API, they <em>are</em> about using mathematical principles, in a mathematically sound way, that just so happens to look like programming and happens to let us solve programming problems. An overarching goal [of functional programming] is to reduce the cognitive overhead, to rely on mathematical principles, to produce code that requires less reading; code that is easier to understand, which frees us up to focus on the important pieces with far less guesswork.</p>

<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Functions - because… in functional programming it is important to understand what a function is <strong>and</strong> what a function is <em>is</em> probably not what you think it is.</li>
  <li>Closure - you do not understand the entirety of functional programming if you do not understand closure. We will understand it.</li>
  <li>Composition - the way that data flows and is mapped through applications.</li>
  <li>Immutability - how we manage the changes to values and state over time. Management of state change is one of the fundamentals of almost all programming.</li>
  <li>Recursion - an incredibly useful too, especially in functional programming.</li>
  <li>Lists / Data Structures - map, filter, reduce… this is what everybody calls functional programming, but with the other sections, these functions are only part of functional programming, not the entirety of what it is.</li>
  <li>Async - the act of applying functional principles over time… aka asynchronous functional programming.</li>
  <li>FP Libraries - a look at some of the libraries available in the wild to use in projects that will help you get the most out of functional programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="function-purity">Function Purity</h2>

<h3 id="functions-vs-procedures">Functions vs Procedures</h3>

<p>What is a function? Let’s start with this inflammatory statement: “Functional programming is not all about the function keyword”. Consider the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">w</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">total</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">extraNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">extraNumbers</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span>
<span class="nx">extraNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 62</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> a function? What about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code>? Are either of them functions? If they are not functions, why not?</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> clearly takes some inputs (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x, y, z, w</code>) and it clearly does something with those inputs, so it is at least kind of like a function, right? Nope. The bar for being a function is a bit higher than that. So… what is it then? The best term that we could use to describe <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> is that it is a ‘procedure’. A procedure is a collection of operations, a collection of things that you need to do in a program. Just because it uses the function keyword does not make it a function. Procedures can take inputs, they can return outputs, they can print to the console, they can be called multiple times. There are a lot of benefits to procedures, but this course is not about procedural programming (yes, its a thing).</p>

<p>Wonderful, but… what is a function? To start, a function not only has to take some input, it also has to return some output. Not just print something to the console, if it does not have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword, it is most definitely not a function! So any ‘function’ that does not have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword is a procedure and a function is more than what we’ve covered so far, we will expand on what a function <strong>is</strong> as we move through this workshop. Oooook, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> isn’t a function, it’s a procedure. What about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code>? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> <strong>has</strong> a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> is function? 😞 No.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> is not a function, because; expanding on the definition of what a function <strong>is</strong>, a function can only call other functions. Functions cannot call procedures (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code>), if they do, they themselves become procedures. Number one in functional programming is that you can’t do functional programming with a thing that is not a function; it has to be a function for you to take advantage of functional principles. So, neither <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> nor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> qualify as functions because they both violate what we have so far learned about what a function is. They are procedures.</p>

<p>How about this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">tuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">tuple</span><span class="p">(...[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">]);</span>

<span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 6</span>
<span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 9</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In JavaScript, a tuple is basically two values in an array. The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tuple</code> has inputs, uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword to return outputs, it is a function?</p>

<h3 id="function-naming-semantics">Function Naming Semantics</h3>

<p>Long story short, yes, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tuple</code> was a function. But if you took that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tuple</code> function and it required the inputs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, but instead of returning those as outputs returned the number 40, would it still be a function? Not really. To better understand what makes a function a function, lets look at some maths:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above might look familiar from some math you may have learned in (not college) school and, unless you were using a graphing calculator, you may recall not really understanding that math in any real concrete sense. The reality of the math above is that you are taking an input value, x, putting it into a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>. The output value will be the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> coordinate, when you combine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, you will see a ‘u’ shape on a graph! Uh huh… But what is a function? A function is a relationship between the input and the output. If you were to write the above maths as a JavaScript function, it might look something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">parabola</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In functional programming, it matters that there is an obvious relationship between the input and output of a function. Again, a function is the semantic relationship between input and computed output. Here’s another example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">size</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="side-effects">Side Effects</h3>

<p>In functional programming there should not be any side effects in functions. But what is meant by side effects? Indirect inputs or outputs. Like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">rate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">rate</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">weight</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">speed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">rate</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 57</span>

<span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">speed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">rate</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above code has no direct relationship between the input and output values, and therefore is not considered a function. If however, we made some changes and made the code look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">size</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>Now in the above code, the (direct) relationship between the input and output values has been created and this qualifies as a function? Yes! The important thing to consider when talking about whether or not a function is a function is to look at where was the function called, which needs to avoid creating or using side effects. But w hat really are the side effects that we need to be concerned about?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I/O (console, files, etc) - Any logs or something dealing with files are considered side effects on the system</li>
  <li>Database Storage</li>
  <li>Network Calls</li>
  <li>Reading from / Writing to the DOM</li>
  <li>Timestamps</li>
  <li>Generating a Random Number</li>
  <li>CPU Heat? - Any program will cause a CPU to compute which in turn will cause it to generate heat which is a side effect</li>
  <li>CPU Time Delay</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only is it impractical to avoid all side effects, but it is theoretically impossible to avoid all side effects. So really, what is meant when it is suggested to avoid side effects is to minimize them. A program with no side effects would be no different than if the program did not exist at all, you couldn’t even prove it existed! The necessity of side effects is undeniable, but we need to make certain that we are as intentional as possible about them and make them obvious.</p>

<h3 id="pure-functions--constants">Pure Functions &amp; Constants</h3>

<p>Continuing to build on our definition of what a function in functional programming is, a ‘pure function’ is one that takes direct inputs and provides direct outputs and has no side effects. Also, as mentioned previously, it is where the function is called that will be the determining factor as to whether or not the function is a function and whether or not it is pure. Consider this code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// pure</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// impure</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addAnother</code> relies on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code>, which would be a value that is potentially unknown at the time of the function call, it is considered impure. But what if the code looked like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> is defined as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> and we could surmise that its value would not change throughout the life of the program, is that valid? Well, it is still consistent with functional principles. But what if you used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>? Would that invalidate the above code as being in line with functional programming? No, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> the above code would still be following / consistent with functional principles. The reason being that in the above code block, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> is never being reassigned and is therefore serving the purpose of a constant value in the application. If you are using something as a constant in your program, it is best to make it as obvious as possible that is what you are doing. It is important for the reader of our code, yes even if that person is ourselves, to know that they do not need to worry whether something will change, this improves code readability.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-surface-area">Reducing Surface Area</h3>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now the codes ‘surface area’ has been reduced. There are only 2 possible places where the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> could be reassigned (inside of the addAnother function before the return statement, and inside of the addTwo function also before the return statement). This should have the effect on the reader of making them confident that when they pass a value into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addAnother</code> function it will stay the same as the value they passed in. The constant nature of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> variable is happening via closure. The above code is both a pure function and a pure function call; they both have predictability which is needed and expected out of pure functions.</p>

<h3 id="same-input-same-output">Same Input, Same Output</h3>

<p>What about this code?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getId</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Would you consider <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getId</code> to be a pure function in the sense that if passed the same object it would always return the same id? What if there was more to the program and it looked like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getId</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">getId</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="kd">get</span> <span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">random</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With the revised code, your confidence level of whether you would get the same id from passing in the same object should have gone to zero. In determining whether or not a function is pure, it is important to see all relevant parts of the program. The more that you can use the techniques outlined in this workshop, to reduce the surface area of where non-functional things can occur, the easier it will be for somebody to read, understand, and ultimately rely upon. We want all readers of our code, again including our future selves, to know from reading our code that they can ‘trust’ it. Pure function calls act in isolation. i.e given the same inputs they should always produce the same output. A pure function is one that whenever it is executed with the same input, it will always give the same output. The goal in functional programming is to design our functions so that as many of the functions as possible will always return the same output when provided the same input, i.e. pure functions.</p>

<h3 id="level-of-confidence">Level of Confidence</h3>

<p>The point of function purity in JavaScript is; how confident are we, the reader, in any given functions behavior? When asked whether or not a function is pure, a binary answer of yes or no will not suffice. The question is not a yes or no question, but one of level of confidence. Something along the lines of “I have a high level of confidence that this function will behave pure” or “I have a low level of confidence that this is a pure function” is more appropriate. The goal being to shift the balance of confidence, as much as possible, to a high degree of confidence in the purity of our functions. And remember that the determining factor, in JavaScript, of whether or not a function behaves pure is at the function call, not the function definition.</p>

<h3 id="extracting-impurity">Extracting Impurity</h3>

<p>If a function is not pure for whatever reason, what are our options? An obvious option would be to leave it as it is; i.e. maybe it must write to a database, this is a side effect and an impurity, but sometimes it has to happen. What you can do is make it obvious that the procedure will have side effects; name it in a way that conveys this, add a comment. The reason for being obvious is to make it easier to maintain the code. Another option would be to look at any given impure function and ask: Is there some way for me to rearrange the way this function works and extract out the impurity, leaving just a pure function in place? This does not mean to remove the impure functionality from your application, but to put the impurity in a place that makes it more obvious. Here is some code to look over:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addComment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">comment</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">record</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">uniqueID</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">text</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">comment</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">elem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">buildCommentElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">record</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nx">commentList</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">elem</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">addComment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">This is my first comment!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above code block, both the function definition and the function call are impure as the function definition will modify the DOM when called, and the function call… modifies the DOM. An additional side effect above is the id being generated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uniqueID()</code>. Is it possible to extract the impurities? We could change it to look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">newComment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">commentID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">comment</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">record</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">commentID</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">text</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">comment</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">buildCommentElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">record</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">commentID</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">uniqueID</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">elem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">newComment</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">commentID</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">This is my first comment!</span><span class="dl">"</span>
<span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">commentList</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">elem</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above does not get rid of any side effects, but extracts them to leave a pure function whenever possible.</p>

<h3 id="containing-impurity">Containing Impurity</h3>

<p>If you cannot extract impurities, another way to handle impurities is to contain them. The goal here is not to have no impurity, but to handle impurity so that it does not have any effect on other parts of the application. If you can reduce the surface area of impurities, this will make your codebase more manageable. Looking at the following code, try to identify impurities and consider how to better contain them:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">SomeAPI</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>Now that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertSortedDesc</code> is wrapped in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getSortedNums</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> variable is restricted to the function scope of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getSortedNums</code>. The side effect of modifying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> array still exists, but it is now contained within a function scope instead of global scope, effectively reducing the impurities surface area. But there is still one additional impurity… <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SomeAPI.threshold = v;</code> is modifying the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">threshold</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SomeAPI</code> object. How can that be contained? We likely cannot wrap it in another function because this is likely a third-parties API service who’s code we do not have access to modify. Containment of this impurity might look like this:</p>

<p>The above code is a very ‘brute force’ way of dealing with side effects which would get very unmanageable very quickly, especially if we were dealing with a more complex set of state; i.e. the DOM. Capturing the current state of the DOM, modifying it, then resetting it is very hard. Same for a database. Again, all of this is just an attempt to reduce the surface area of side effects, ideally improving code readability and maintainability.</p>

<h3 id="impurity-exercise-wrappers--adapters">Impurity Exercise: Wrappers &amp; Adapters</h3>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<p>This is a two-part exercise to practice two techniques for containing function impurity.</p>

<p>Instructions (Part 1)</p>

<p>In this part of the exercise, you will contain the function impurity of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByName(..)</code> using a wrapper function.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not modify the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByName(..)</code> for this exercise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Move and modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByName(..)</code> so that it wraps around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByName(..)</code> (and calls it internally).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByName(..)</code> should receive the current list of students, and return a new sorted list of students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByName(..)</code> doesn’t have a side-effect of modifying the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">students</code> array.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest3</code> tests at the bottom of the exercise should all print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Instructions (Part 2)</p>

<p>In this part of the exercise, you will contain the function impurity of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByID(..)</code> using an adapter function.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not modify the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByID(..)</code> for this exercise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByID(..)</code> so that it is an adapter that calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByID(..)</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentByID(..)</code> should receive the current list of students, and return a new sorted list of students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByID(..)</code> doesn’t have a side-effect of modifying the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">students</code> array.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All tests (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest2</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest3</code>) at the bottom of the exercise should all print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>
  </li>

<h2 id="argument-adapters">Argument Adapters</h2>

<h3 id="function-arguments">Function Arguments</h3>

<p>Shifting from to the arguments that functions receive. Parameter and argument are generally used interchangeably, but they are technically different. The generally accepted definition is that a parameter is the ‘thing’ in the function definition and an argument is the value that gets passed in when you call the function. Put more simply, arguments get assigned to parameters. And to throw some confusion in there, both parameters and arguments can be considered inputs. Here’s some code to look at:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// unary</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// binary</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Throughout the remainder of this course, the instructor will be describing the ‘shape’ of functions which will speak to the number and kinds of things that get passed into and returned from functions. In the above code block, the ‘shape’ of the two functions is described in the comment above each of the respective function definitions; unary and binary. The shape of a function is quite critical and functional programmers are obsessed with the shape of functions. For functions that we create, it is important to be cognizant of their shape; what arguments will they receive, what will they return. Functional programmers tend to prefer unary functions; those with a single input and a single output, followed by binary functions; two inputs, single output. The more inputs a function has, the harder it is to make it work with other functions, the harder it is to get the shapes to fit.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about higher order functions. A higher order function is a function that either receives, as its inputs, one or more functions, and/or returns one or more functions. In the above code, the variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> and  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code> are creating copies of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unary</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary</code> functions respectively, with the function definition <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> being passed in as an argument. So, when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g(1, 2, 3, 4)</code> is called, it only returns the first number in the supplied arguments, effectively limiting, or adapting, the shape of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> to the definition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unary</code>; only takes (and returns) a single argument. Adapter and higher order functions are at the core of functional programming.</p>

<h3 id="flip--reverse-adapter">Flip &amp; Reverse Adapter</h3>

<p>Let’s look at a couple of adapter functions; flip and reverse. Starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">flip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">flip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// [2, 1, 3, 4]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code> is a function that…flips the order of some of the supplied arguments; in the above example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code> flips the first two of the supplied arguments. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code> is a common method that you might find in utility libraries. A somewhat less common example that you may come across is a reverse arguments method. That looks something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">reverseArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">reversed</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">reverse</span><span class="p">());</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">reverseArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// [4, 3, 2, 1]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This may not be a situation you come across, but the above will reverse the supplied arguments that are passed in. When you find yourself struggling to ‘fit’ together functions that have different shapes, can you refactor the functions to make them better fit one another or do you need to write an adapter function to make them fit? While it is possible to make a variety of utility functions to modify the shape of other functions, it is best practice to try and write your functions as close to a familiar functional programming approach as possible so that it is familiar at a glance without some reader of your code having to trace all of the transformations and shape changes.</p>

<h3 id="spread-adapter">Spread Adapter</h3>

<p>Another of shape adaptation that commonly occurs in functional programming is having a function that takes numerous individual arguments, but you want to call that function with an array. To do this, we can use the spread operator:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">spreadArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">spread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">w</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">w</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">spreadArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">g</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]);</span> <span class="c1">// 10</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The spread operator is the same as JavaScrips’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.apply</code> method; it ‘spreads’ the array out so that each value becomes it’s own value, separate from the array.</p>
