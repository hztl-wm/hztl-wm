intro: |
  My name is William Harrison, I am currently an Associate Frontend Developer at Horizontal Digital. If you would like to see how many cans of La Croíx I have drank since I started at Horizontal, check the footer.

  I am currently using this site to keep track of worknotes, resources, and the workshops I am taking through Frontend Masters. The learning I have to do will likely be unceasing. That's fine, check out some of my things if you made it this far!
